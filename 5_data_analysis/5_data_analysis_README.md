## Overview and Aims <a name="overview"></a>
In this module, we will cover key concepts in NMR-based and LC-MS/MS – based metabolome data analysis. We will use pre-processed spectra data for conducting chemometrics analysis in order to visualise the patterns, trends, selecting outliers, or further investigating the classification and potential biomarkers. We will use the example data of Pla-ra that were prepared by two methods and collected at three different time points. We could ask if and how the metabolic profiling of Pla-ra collected is different over time and how those differences are affected by the methods of preparation.

## Introduction to MetaboAnalyst <a name="intro"></a>
MetaboAnlayst created by Wishart Research Group (University of Alberta, Canada) is a web-based platform for metabolomic data analysis and interpretation. Since the first version released in 2009, the platform has undergone continuous development and expansion in a variety of functional models that have been tailored for metabolomic data including data processing, statistical analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and metabolic pathway analysis. The platform also supports a wide array of data input types generated from different metabolomic approaches consisting of metabolite concentrations, spectra bins/peak table, MS/NMR peak lists or intensity table, and LC-MS raw spectra. Given its strengths in analysis methods and diverse data input, MetaboAnalyst is recognised as a friendly and comprehensive platform for metabolomics data analysis.
