# R crash-course
In this session, you will be introduced to R programming. R is a computer language and work on command line tools. We can use R on a plain command line window or we can use it on RStudio IDE (Integrated Development Environment i.e. a software that provide friendlier environment for writting code!). RStudio provide additional features such as code syntax hilight (make your code easier to read and to spot errors), space to view and manipulate plots, and useful interface such as command history tab and environment tab that list your object, dataset, functions etc.

For metabolomics, we can use R for data pre-processing and data analysis for both NMR and LC-MS data. In this CliNaP-M workshop, however, we will use R for NMR data only, to introduce you to a variety of tools and approach for metabolomics data processing.
