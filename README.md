# CliNaP-M (April 2022)
Practical hands-on training in food metabolome analysis

## Course overview

Metabolomics is one of the most renowned and emerging research methodologies in the 21st century that quantitatively and qualitatively measure the level of
metabolites in clinical specimens such as urine, plasma, serum, feces and tissues. It provides systemic understanding of altered biochemical pathways in
response to certain stimuli or conditions. In addition, the biomarkers or fingerprints of particular diseases or medical conditions such as diabetes,
hypertension, some cancers and other metabolic dysregulation-related diseases can effectively be monitored through metabolic profiling. Metabolomics has
been employed in not only clinical research but also natural product studies. Combining metabolomics with pattern recognition, the effectiveness surpasses
the traditional fractionation, which is time-consuming and cost-effective. Therefore, bioactive compounds can be easily identified from crude extracts. 
The Clinical and Natural Product Metabolomics (CliNaP-M) Short Course has been established to gather researchers for catching up the state-of-art
information to the same pace and also to provide a sharing platform in order to put metabolic profiling at ease for everyone.  In the CliNaP-M online Short
Course, attendees will learn all the basic principles in metabolomics and they can then apply their knowledge and understanding in the hands-on sessions
covering how to design metabolomic study, prepare samples, acquire, analyse and interpret metabolomic data with our well experienced instructors in the
field.

### Target audience
The CliNaP-M short course is aimed at researchers at various levels including senior research assistants, PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, 
laboratory scientists, biomedical scientists and clinical scientists.

### Prerequisites
Participants are strongly recommended to attend the online course in Basic Principle of Metabolomics for Clinical and Natural Product Research avialble on
KKUMEDX platform (https://kkumedx.md.kku.ac.th).
