# Data pre-processing 
Before performing statistical analysis, data pre-processing is a very crucial step following data acquisition. This is to ensure the good quality of spectral data that may need some corrections in baseline and alignment. Missing data need to be reimputed. Normalisation may also be required for some datasets.
