## General information <a name="general"></a>
### Fermented fish sample
The fermented fish samples were divided into two main groups including raw and cooked fermented fish. In addition, each group was divided in three subgroups according to their fermented time points 0 week, 2 and 6 weeks. The samples were stored in -80°C until metabolite extraction.

### Reagents and equipment
#### 1. Chemical reagent
-	HPLC-grade water
-	Chloroform
-	Methanol
-	Acetonitrile
-	NMR buffer, D2O containing KH2PO4, NaN3 and 0.1% TSP, pH 7.4 

#### 2. Equipment
- Autopipette
-	1000 µl pipette tips
-	1.5 ml tubes
-	Centri vap
-	0.2 µm filter 
- Syring
- NMR tubes
-	Glass vials

## Metabolite extraction <a name="metabolite"></a>
Extract metabolites from fermented fish samples using chloroform/methanol/water extraction method
1. Weight 500 mg of raw and cooked fermented fish and take into 15 mL tube 
2. Add 2 mL of methanol, 2 ml chloroform and 1.425 ml of water
3. Homogenize and vortex  
4. Incubate sample on ice for 15 minutes 
5. Centrifuge at 1,000g 4°C for 15 minutes  
6. Transfer supernatant to the clean tube and evaporate at 40°C for 20 hours
7. Keep tissue extract at -80°C prior to further analysis

**_Our demonstrators have already done the above procedures for you, you will be performing the experiment from Step 7 onwards._**

## LC-MS sample preparation <a name="lcms"></a>
- Thaw sample for 10 minutes and add 1 mL of HPLC-graded water:ACN 1:1 (v:v) to reconstitute the aqueous phase
-	Vortex and sonicate sample with ultrasonic bath 3 time or until get the homogeneous sample
-	Centrifuge 13,000 rpm at 4ºC for 10 minutes 
- 1 mL of samples were filtered with 0.2 µm filter 
-	800 µL of sample was transferred into 2 mL glass vial
- Store at 4ºC prior to UHPLC-MS analysis
