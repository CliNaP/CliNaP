## Experimental design <a name="expdesign"></a>
The datasets used in this hands-on CliNaP-M short course (April 2022) is part of the project, namely, "Investigation of satisfaction-related molecular components in fermented fish seasoning (Pla-Ra)for improving industrial production" funded by Thailand Science Research and Innovation to Dr. Jutarop Phetchraburanin who is the legal owner of all datasets. Hence, all datasets provided in this short course should be stricly used for academic training purposes by KKUIPL only - all rights reserved. 

This sub-experiment aimed to investigate the metabolic differences in fermented fish with different fermentation times including baseline (day 0), week 2 and week 6 and different conditions: raw and cooked samples. All fermented fish samples were extracted using dual-phase extraction (methanol:chloroform:water, 1:3:1 [v/v/v]). Aqueous extracts were analysed using NMR and LC-MS to explore the alterations in nutritional, functional and toxic metabolite pools at different fermentation times and conditions. In addition, odour satisfaction was assessed by food experts and data were recorded. Metabolome data can then be integrated with odour satisfaction using chemometrics in order to investigate odour satisfaction-related metabolites. The outcomes of this experiment can aid the fermented fish manufacturer to formulate their products that suit the customer demands.

## Group work <a name="groupwork"></a>
Groups 1 - 3 are provided with NMR dataset while groups 4 - 6 obtain LC-MS dataset. Odour satisfaction score is given to all groups for correlation analysis.

Here are the tasks to be addressed at the end of short course for each group:
- Group 1: How do the NMR metabolite profiles of fermented fish differ at different fermentation time points of each condition?
- Group 2: How do the NMR metabolite profiles of raw fermented fish differ from those of the cooked ones at each fermentation time point?
- Group 3: Investigate the relationship between NMR metabolome and odour satisfaction?
- Group 4: How do the LC-MS metabolite profiles of fermented fish differ at different fermentation time points of each condition?
- Group 5: How do the LC-MS metabolite profiles of raw fermented fish differ from those of the cooked ones at each fermentation time point?
- Group 6: Investigate the relationship between LC-MS/MS metabolome and odour satisfaction?
- Groups 1 & 4, 2 & 5 and 3 & 6: Compare and contrast your results between NMR and LC-MS/MS datasets.

**Please note that if you are intereted in addressing the other tasks apart from your one, please feel free to do so. However, in your final group presentation, you need to present only your group task. Your extra results can be secretly kept for our class discussion :)**
