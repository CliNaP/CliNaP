## Experimental design <a name="expdesign"></a>
The datasets used in this hands-on CliNaP-M short course (April 2022) is part of the project, namely, "Investigation of satisfaction-related molecular components in fermented fish seasoning (Pla-Ra)for improving industrial production" funded by Thailand Science Research and Innovation to Dr. Jutarop Phetchraburanin. Hence, all datasets provided in this short course should be stricly used for academic service purposes and all rights reserved for CliNaP-M (April 2022) hands-on sessions only.
This sub-experiment aimed to investigate the metabolic differences in fermented fish with different fermentation times including baseline (day 0), week 2 and week 6 and different conditions: raw and cooked samples. All fermented fish samples were extracted using dual-phase extraction  In addition, odour satisfaction was assessed by food experts and data were recorded.
